## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I tend to ask questions too soon so I am trying to find the right balance between the time it takes for me to look up the answer myself and when I need to ask for help.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The three primitive data types are string, boolean, and number. String data types are used to represent text. Boolean data types are used to represent true or false statements. Number data types are used to represent numbers.


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```javascript
var exclamation = 'Hello World!'
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You would use the back ticks and the phrase "javascript" to indicate comments in a JavaScript file. A code comment allows the program developer to mention additional information associated with the program.


5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable a value that can change depending on the conditions or on the information passed to the program.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I often use Airbnb. Airbnb probably uses the variables of location, price, and ratings. Location would result in a string data type. Price would result in a number data type. Ratings would result in a number data type as well.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
This is the operation of joining two strings together.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Facebook uses concatenation. This app combines multiple strings within every single Facebook profile.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

What would be an example where interpolation is preferred over concatenation and vise versa?
