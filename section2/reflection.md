## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I appreciated the idea to only keep track of your own progress and to never compare yourself to others. Its more beneficial to remind yourself of how far you've come rather than comparing your pace to the pace of others. I also appreciated the idea that anyone is truly capable of teaching themselves anything. I hope to apply this growth mindset approaching every task now because it can help prevent anxiety and stress.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I demonstrate the growth mindset in the belief that I am constantly evolving and learning. However, there are some tasks that make it very easy to think in the fixed mindset. These tasks are usually tasks that I dislike. I find its much easier to think with the growth mindset when approaching tasks that interest me.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

At first it felt uncomfortable but once I got into the habit of looking back into my notes, I was able to navigate between pages and it became easier to find information. This has pushed my learning to write down _everything_.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is based on a concept if/then/else; if a condition is met then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something different.

1 example of a daily life conditional: If the traffic light is red, you should stop. If the traffic light is green, you should go. If the traffic light is yellow you should slow down.

1 example of where a conditional is used in a web app: I use waze. Waze tells me when the best time to leave my destination is based on the current traffic. So if I want to spend an hour in traffic, I should leave now. If I want to spend 15 minutes in traffic, I should leave in 30 minutes.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

I would add multiple conditions using the logical operators. This allows me to incorporate the joining words "and" and "or" into the current decision being made.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

We can use the logical operators && and || in a comparison. We can also run node inside of the file we want to test.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
What are more examples of apps that use these statements?
